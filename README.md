SPARK Peregrinator is a multifunctional explorer rover , focused on detecting and supplying data that are important for inhabiting space, not just life, but also those on the basis of which we can plan our journey to the planet. In further circumstances, this can serve as their ‘space-pet’ to enter small places and retrieve data.

For our project, we have chosen the Challenge theme, ‘Inhabiting Space’, which we felt, is the true need of the hour. A successful attempt in inhibiting space will push our country long ahead, and also, we can get some unprecedented data about another planet.

We wanted to make a small yet useful multipurpose inhabitation-oriented explorer that can retrieve a lot of data, the weight and accommodation still being low enough not  to put  pressure as a payload.

Our project is exhibited as a 3D Model, designed to be equipped with advanced IoT and Sensors technology, with the ATMega328p-based  Arduino UNO module serving as its microcontroller.
The advanced technology integration has a SHARP-2Y0A02-distance-sensor to avoid obstacles, making it capable of autonomous service, and has a special type of wheel framework with 6 separately driven grooved-wheels, where the framework is free to move on its own , self-customizing along every terrain to apply least jerk on the body. It has two triple-pivot arms to increase its range of operation, one holding a camera, another having a digger carrying soil and rock samples.

It has also been equipped with a CMOS IR Camera Module, a magnetometer, an accelerometer, and an IR sensor, in case it serves as a remote-sensing ‘space-pet’, and most importantly, the Microstrip antennae, that can study geological and radiological conditions of the planet, and the predictability and frequency of earthquakes on the planet . It works on an RF Module Tx to transmit data to nearest DSN-connectors placed in the lander or mSat.

Its power-system is based on a two 1.5 V cells inside, recharged with 3 solar panels, tilted at suitable angles for all-season harnessing.

***Believe me! It will work once developed.***
